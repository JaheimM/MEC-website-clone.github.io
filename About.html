        <section class="message">
           <p> Greetings,</p>
            
          <p>On behalf of the faculty of the School of Business, I welcome you to the Medgar Evers College School of Business and
            invite you to further explore the College on your road to realizing your dreams, goals and aspirations. Please know that
            we are committed to the development of the essential skills and knowledge of our students so that they are prepared both
            academically and professionally. </p>  
            <br>
           <p>We have a business curriculum that provides our students with a broad-based appreciation of the different business
            subjects, as well as depth in the disciplines by way of our five (5) baccalaureate programs. In addition, each is
            designed to afford you with the opportunity to further specialize in a particular area.
           </p>  
           <br>
           <p>
               Your success here at Medgar Evers College and beyond is of personal importance to me, and I encourage you to take full
            advantage of the resources that are available at the institution. The School of Business has a caring and dedicated
            faculty and staff with both the theoretical aptitude and practical experience to provide you with a robust and
            well-rounded experience. In addition, we have part-time faculty members that are subject-matter specialists in their
            respective fields and come to the classroom often times from their full-time jobs in government, business and industry,
            or nonprofit fields to share their knowledge with you.
           </p>  
           <br>
           <p>
               Remember, too, that learning only begins in the classroom and that it is cultivated and nurtured in your
            extra-curricular and co-curricular activities. We have student clubs and organizations that supplement classroom
            instruction through competitions, case studies, and service to the College and community. These clubs are focused on
            particular areas of interest like advertising, marketing, accounting, public health, law, or entrepreneurship, and also
            allow you to explore and cultivate your managerial and leadership skills prior to graduation. Additional information can
            be found on the Office of Student Life & Development webpage at: <a href="https://www.mec.cuny.edu/student-affairs/student-affairs/office-of-student-life-development/">Office of Student Life & Development</a> 
          </p>  
           <br>
           <p>Finally, I encourage you to take advantage of internships, fellowships, and international experiences—all of which
            prepare you for today’s global society. There are many possibilities for both short-term and semester-long study aboard
            experiences. Study abroad opportunities are open to all students who are eligible. For more information, visit the
            Office of Study Abroad Programs webpage at: <a href="https://www.mec.cuny.edu/academic-affairs/office-of-academic-affairs/offices/65-2/"> Office of Study Abroad</a>
          </p>   
          <br>
           <p>In addition, please visit the Career Management Services Center homepage for more information regarding professional
            development, i.e. internship/job search assistance, career coaching, mock interviews, industry exposure, resume review &
            approval at: <a href="https://www.mec.cuny.edu/office-of-academic-affairs/career-management-services/"> Career Management Services </a> 
           </p>  
           <br>
           <p>Sincerely,</p>
