            <p>The School of Business at Medgar Evers College has been fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for
                Business Schools &amp; Programs (ACBSP) since 2003.&nbsp; Of the five business schools in CUNY, Medgar Evers
                College is one of the two that is accredited.&nbsp;The School of Business is an intimate educational environment
                that affords close mentoring relationships between faculty and staff, in which approximately 70% of its students
                are matriculating in career focused baccalaureate programs.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The School of Business is home to the Lambda Rho Chapter of Delta Mu Delta, an international business honor
                society, with over 290 chapters worldwide. &nbsp;Delta Mu Delta provides students with a proven track record of
                academic achievement with the opportunity to be inducted and afforded with: lifetime membership; access to a
                network of business professionals; and scholarship opportunities.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The&nbsp;mission&nbsp;of the School of Business is to emphasize excellence in undergraduate business education in
                the context of the liberal arts, and to prepare students for administrative and managerial careers in both the
                private and public sectors; as well as preparation for graduate and/or professional studies; entrepreneurship;
                and leadership roles in their careers and communities.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The&nbsp;vision&nbsp;for the School of Business is to be an institution in which students are endowed with the
                education, skills, and resources that are necessary to lead Brooklynâ€™s renaissance from both the public and
                private sectors, as well as at the grassroots level.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The collective&nbsp;philosophy&nbsp;of the faculty provides that the foundation of a quality business education
                must be Transformative, Relevant, Enlightening, &amp; Empowering.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transformative:</strong>&nbsp;Transforming students into professionals;</li>
                <li><strong>Relevant:</strong>&nbsp;Meeting the needs of the public and private sectors as well as the community
                    in the 21st Century;</li>
                <li><strong>Enlightening:</strong>&nbsp;Providing students with the insight to uplift themselves and their
                    community; and</li>
                <li><strong>Empowering:</strong>&nbsp;Providing students with the abilities, skills and knowledge to be leaders
                    in their chosen careers and community.</li>
            </ul>
